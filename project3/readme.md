     This is an implementation of a CPU scheduler, where three different scheduling algorithms (SJF, FCFS, Priority) can be chosen.
     Jobs arriving with different distributions. and they have random burst times. 
     
     
        "[run] <job> <time> <priority> ",
        "[quit] <-i/-d> Exit immediately or delayed ",
        "[help] Print help menu ",
        "[fcfs] change the scheduling policy to fcfs",
        "[sjf] change the scheduling policy to sjf",
        "[priority] change the scheduling policy to priority",
        "[list] display the job status.",
        "[test] test the scheduler with a given benchmark workload information",
        "[Listfinish] display the finished job queue.",
